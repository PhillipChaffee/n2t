# Nand 2 Tetris

This is a repository for the code I write while working through the book The Elements of Computing Systems - Building a Modern Computer from First Principles.

Its authors are Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken.

The book walks the reader through the construction of a 16-bit von Neumann machine starting with only Nand gates.
